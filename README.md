The method proposed in the paper is used for two tasks: question answering and language modeling. It uses a neural network with a recurrent attention model. Model requires less supervision in training which makes the model more applicable to realistic problems. For the question answering, model takes a set of sequential sentences and a question, then gives an answer. For language modeling, it predicts the new word given previous words. Performance of the model is better at question answering and comparable at language modeling relative to other models.
